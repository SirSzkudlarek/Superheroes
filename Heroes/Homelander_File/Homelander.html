            Homelander is sick person.
            I don't mean this in good way, he's psychopath and overpowered.
            Only thing that keeps him from getting out of loose is how potray him people.

            Homelander is complicated character, one that watch his tale might get confused with own feelings.
            They are moments in the show where I can feel hatred just to ten minutes later feel sorry for him.

            His character might not be this way if not for the company that created this sick world of his. 
            I think that he's great power and world he was put in, created a monster that he become.
